This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit type coercion. VBScript's loose typing can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you don't explicitly declare variable and parameter types. The bug.vbs file shows a function with implicit typing that might behave unexpectedly depending on the types of input parameters. The solution shows the corrected version with explicit type declarations.
